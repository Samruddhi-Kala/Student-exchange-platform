<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;">To solve the problem of accessibility and affordability of educational tools, we plan to develop a user-friendly website dedicated to facilitating the buying, selling, and exchanging of academic resources. Users will have to register with their college email-id. The platform will feature various items like textbooks, lab equipment, software, and calculators, with detailed listings. Search and filter options will help users quickly find specific items. Transaction methods, through payment gateways such as UPI options and COD will be used. Delivery options will include local pickup and tracked shipping services. There will also be user ratings and reviews for trust.  Pricing guidance based on market trends will help users set fair prices. Community engagement will be fostered through forums and discussion boards where students can share experiences and tips.</p>
